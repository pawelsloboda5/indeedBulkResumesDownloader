**Version 3.0.0**

Bulk download all candidate resumes from your Indeed Employer dashboard in one click. No extension, no manual export — just run and go.

## How It Works

1. **Run the script** (or the `.exe`)
2. **Log in** to your Indeed Employer account in the Chrome window that opens
3. **Choose your options** (download mode, which jobs, status filter)
4. **Let it run** — resumes are downloaded as PDFs, organized by job folder

That's it. On the next run, your session is remembered and already-downloaded CVs are skipped.

## Privacy & Security

- **100% local** — All data stays on your machine. Nothing is sent to any external server.
- **No credentials stored** — The script never sees or saves your password. You log in yourself in Chrome.
- **Session cookies only** — Saved locally in `logs/indeed_cookies.json` to avoid re-login. They expire after ~24h.
- **Open source** — You can read every line of code. No telemetry, no analytics, no tracking.

## Standalone Executable (No Python Required)

A pre-built executable is available in the `dist/` folder — just download and run, no Python needed.

### Quick Start

1. Download `IndeedCVDownloader.exe` from the `dist/` folder
2. Double-click to run
3. Log in to your Indeed Employer account in the Chrome window that opens
4. Choose your options in the menu and start downloading!

> No Python, no extension, no configuration needed.

## Installation (Python)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YasserLoukniti/indeed-cv-downloader.git
cd indeed-cv-downloader
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run

```bash
python indeed_downloader.py
```

### 4. (Optional) Custom configuration

```bash
cp .env.example .env.config
```

## Features

### Authentication
- **Automatic**: Chrome opens, you log in once, cookies are captured and reused
- **Session persistence**: Saved cookies are validated on each run — no re-login until they expire
- **Expiry detection**: If cookies are invalid, the script asks you to log in again

### Download Modes
- **Backend (API)** — Fast parallel downloads via Indeed's GraphQL API
- **Frontend (Selenium)** — Slower but more stable, simulates real browser clicks

### Job Selection
- **Single job** — Navigate to a specific job, press Enter
- **All jobs** — Automatically fetches and processes every job from your dashboard

### Smart Features
- **Resume on interruption** — Checkpoint system lets you stop and restart without losing progress
- **Duplicate detection** — Already downloaded CVs are skipped (by name and ID)
- **New candidates only** — On re-run, only downloads CVs added since last time
- **Folder matching** — Matches existing download folders to jobs by name and date
- **Status filter** — Filter jobs by Open, Paused, or Closed
- **Old job filter** — Jobs older than 2 years are skipped (Indeed archives data)
- **Multi-pass fetch** — Bypasses Indeed's 3000 candidate limit using multiple sort strategies
- **Report generation** — Creates `download_report.txt` with stats per job

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Cookies expired | Just re-run — the script will detect it and ask you to log in again |
| Chrome won't open | Close all existing Chrome windows first |
| Jobs missing from list | Check if the page loaded correctly, increase `PAGE_LOAD_DELAY` |
| Downloads failing | Increase `DOWNLOAD_DELAY` in `.env.config` |
| Script interrupted | Re-run it — checkpoint picks up where you left off |
